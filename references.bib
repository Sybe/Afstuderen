          abstract = {Model checking of timed automata is a widely used technique. But in order to take advantage of modern hardware, the algorithms need to be parallelized. We present a multi-core reachability algorithm for the more general class of well-structured transition systems, and an implementation for timed automata.
Our implementation extends the opaal tool to generate a timed automaton successor generator in c++, that is efficient enough to compete with the UPPAAL model checker, and can be used by the discrete model checker LTSmin, whose parallel reachability algorithms are now extended to handle subsumption of semi-symbolic states. The reuse of efficient lockless data structures guarantees high scalability and efficient memory use.
With experiments we show that opaal+LTSmin can outperform the current state-of-the-art, UPPAAL. The added parallelism is shown to reduce verification times from minutes to mere seconds with speedups of up to 40 on a 48-core machine. Finally, strict BFS and (surprisingly) parallel DFS search order are shown to reduce the state count, and improve speedups.},

          abstract = {The LTSMIN toolset provides a new level of modular design to high-performance model checkers. Its distinguishing feature is the wide spectrum of supported specification languages and model checking paradigms. On the language side, it supports process algebras (MCRL), state based languages (PROMELA, DVE) and even discrete abstractions of ODE models (MAPLE, GNA). On the algorithmic side (Sec. 3.2), it supports two main streams in high-performance model checking: reachability analysis based on BDDs (symbolic) and on a cluster of workstations (distributed, enumerative). LTSMIN also incorporates a distributed implementation of state space minimization, preserving strong or branching bisimulation.

        abstract = {In this paper, we present a symbolic reachability algorithm for process algebras with recursive data types. Like the various saturation based algorithms of Ciardo et al, the algorithm is based on partitioning of the transition relation into events whose influence is local. As new features, our algorithm supports recursive data types and allows unbounded non-determinism, which is needed to support open systems with data. The algorithm does not use any specific features of process algebras. That is, it will work for any system that consists of a fixed number of communicating processes, where in each atomic step only a subset of the processes participate. As proof of concept we have implemented the algorithm in the context of the ?CRL toolset. We also compared the performance of this prototype with the performance of the existing explicit tools on a set of typical case studies.}
