First of all I would like to thank my committee, Jaco van de Pol for his guidance and steering of the project, Arnd Hartmanns for for all his comments on my writings, Rom Langerak for his last minute entering into the committee. Also thanks to Jeroen Meijer for his guidance and help during the entire process. \\


Thanks to Jip for proofreading my thesis, for sparring with me on some ideas, and her support during my final project.\\


Thanks to all my housemates from my former house Calslaan "Kings Corner" 7-1. Thanks to D.S.V. De Skeuvel for keeping both my body and mind in shape, and for all the fun moments besides the trainings. Thanks to the entire FMT group for letting me be part of the group and giving me a room to work in.
